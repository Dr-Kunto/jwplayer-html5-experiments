Introduction
------------
This project is a fork of in-dev code from over at LongTail where they are currently experimenting on where they can take their HTML5-Flash video player next. Having played around with many of the other solutions on the market (and OSS), I dont see a decent solution for people wishing to use HTML5 video with playlists (cross-browser and device compatible with a Flash fallback for the playlists too). With this in mind, I'm going to try seeing how far I can take the in-dev code to provide it with a visual playlist component/feature. Note that this may require a version freeze (this is in-dev LongTail 5.4 I'm working with) - we have no idea whether playlists will be in the next HTML5 integrated release of their player or not. In the mean time, let the coding commence!
